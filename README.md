Olist E-Commerce Performance Dashboard
An interactive Excel dashboard designed to analyze e-commerce sales performance and logistics efficiency using the Olist dataset.

Project Overview
This project transforms raw e-commerce data into a visual management tool. It was my first practical experience with Power Query and Power Pivot as an autodidact student learning data analysis. The dashboard provides a high-level view of sales volume, revenue trends, and delivery performance, allowing stakeholders to identify regional strengths and logistical bottlenecks. It still has a lot to improve, such as new KPIs, new graphs, better UX/UI, and more.
