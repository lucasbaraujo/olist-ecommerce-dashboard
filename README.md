This project transforms raw e-commerce data into a visual management tool. It was my first practical experience with Power Query and Power Pivot as an autodidact student learning data analysis. The dashboard provides a view of sales volume, revenue trends, and delivery performance, allowing stakeholders to identify regional strengths and logistical bottlenecks. It is fully written in Brazilian Portuguese and still has a lot to improve, such as new KPIs, new graphs, better UX/UI, and more. 

Key Metrics (KPIs)

Total Sales: 99,441 orders.

Average Ticket (Ticket Médio): R$ 136.68.

Cancellation Rate: 1%.

Average Delivery Time: 12.5 Days.

On-Time Delivery Rate: 93%.

Total Revenue: R$ 13.59M.

Total Sellers: 3095

Interactive Features
Dynamic Filters: Users can filter all visuals by State (Estado), Year, Review, and Quarter (Trimestre).

Geographic Distribution: A map visualization showing order density across Brazil.

Trend Analysis: A monthly revenue chart to identify seasonal patterns.

Logistics Tracking: A monthly breakdown of on-time delivery percentages.

Technologies Used
Microsoft Excel: Pivot Tables, Slicers, custom charting, and dashboard design for UX/UI.

Power Query: For data cleaning and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.

Power Pivot: For connecting and loading a huge amount of data without overloading Excel and my computer, and using some basic DAX functions

It was my first time dealing with Power Pivot and Power Query in particular, so there may be some errors or bad practices that I want to come back in the future.
